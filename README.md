# Estimation of State Of Health of battery cells by machine learning using experimental data.
### Problem definition
The battery cells experience loss of capacity as they are used. This is shown in figure 1. as the time passes the unusable part which is shown as rock content gets bigger and so we will have a lower capacity. This effect ca be seen as fast charge and decharge of the battery. In other words the active part is filed and drained much faster compared to the new cell.

Now the problem here is that this active part that we call "the capacity" cannot be measured easily and it needs lab equipment
